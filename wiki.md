# Foodgen

## Ingredient-Based Meal Generation:

- Users can manually input ingredients they have at home or search for products via the Open Food Facts API.
- The system allows users to maintain a digital "fridge" inventory by adding or removing ingredients.

## Customizable Recipe Parameters:

- Users can set specific parameters such as the desired number of servings, dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, low-carb), and meal preparation time.

## AI-Generated Recipes and Visualizations:

- FoodGen leverages ChatGPT to create detailed step-by-step recipes tailored to the user's selected ingredients and preferences.
- Additionally, the platform can generate realistic images of the prepared dish, providing a complete visualization of the meal.

## Seamless Integration with Open Food Facts:

- The platform retrieves product details, including nutritional values, allergens, and brand information, directly from the Open Food Facts database.
- This ensures that recipes are not only personalized but also nutritionally informative.

## Interactive and Intuitive User Interface:

- The Fridge Page allows users to manage their ingredient list effortlessly, providing an option to search and add products or manually input ingredients.
- Once the ingredients are selected, users can generate meals with a single click, receiving detailed recipe instructions and nutritional information.

## Output Customization and Sharing:

- Users can modify the generated recipes by replacing ingredients or changing serving sizes and regenerate outputs accordingly.
- The platform also offers options for sharing recipes directly on social media or saving them for future use.
